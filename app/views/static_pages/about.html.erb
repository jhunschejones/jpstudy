  <p>
    Welcome to the alpha version of jpstudy! If you want to be one of the first Japanese language learners to get started with our new tools, feel free to <%= link_to("sign up", signup_path) %> today. There are still several features on the way, so you can expect to see the site grow and evolve in the coming months. <em>(We plan to support any migrations required so that no user-generated content is lost along the way!)</em>
  </p>

  <h3 class="title">What makes jpstudy special?</h3>

  <h4 class="title">We like tools that are easy to use</h4>
  <p>
    Our goal is to build simple tools that do not take much onboarding and serve as force-multipliers for language learners looking to maximize the efficiency of their study time. Start off with our super-snappy <%= link_to "word list", @current_user ? words_path(@current_user) : login_path(destination: "R01") %> to help keep track of the words you want to study. From there, we'll automatically tell you what <%= link_to "kanji", @current_user ? next_kanji_path(@current_user) : login_path(destination: "R02") %> you should learn next. Pro tip: zip around the site with <%= link_to "keyboard shortcuts", keyboard_shortcuts_path %> to make these tools even faster!
  </p>

  <p>
    We understand that your tool selection might change during different seasons of your language learning journey. We know it's the worst getting locked into something when you are ready for a change, so we provide <%= link_to "import", @current_user ? import_words_path(@current_user) : login_path(destination: "R05") %> and <%= link_to "export", @current_user ? export_words_path(@current_user) : login_path(destination: "R05") %> functionality for all the content you create on jpstudy.app.
  </p>

  <h4 class="title">We are just here to fill the gaps</h4>
  <p>
    jpstudy aims to fill gaps we have noticed in existing Japanese language study tools. It does not seek to replace important study tools like dictionaries or digital flashcard applications, but rather to make these existing tools easier to use.
