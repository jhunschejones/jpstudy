  <p>
    In order to prevent abuse and provide the best experience for all jpstudy users, new accounts are created with a default word limit. This limit currently starts at <%= User::DEFAULT_WORD_LIMIT %>, and you will see warnings if you try to add additional words once you have reached your word limit.

  <h3 class="title">How do I add more words?</h3>

  <p>
    The default word limit is intentionally set high enough to give users plenty of headroom as they begin their studies. If you are using the site long enough that you manage to reach this limit, congrats ðŸŽ‰ We are so excited for you and we will be happy to raise your word limit at no additional cost. Please reach out to <a href="mailto:support@jpstudy.app">support@jpstudy.app</a> to explain how you're using the app and we will make sure you have plenty of space to achieve your study goals.
