    🚗 It looks like you are ready to move on to your next language learning tool! Before you go, make sure that you download the content you created on jpstudy. Once you delete your account, we will go ahead and close out your subscription through Square and delete all your user content. <strong>Content deletion happens very quickly and is a permanent action</strong> so make sure you take what you need before you go! 👋

    It's been a pleasure serving you and we wish you all the best on your language learning journey. 🙇 頑張って！
