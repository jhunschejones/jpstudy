  <p>
    jpstudy is built on the idea that users should own the content they create. To support that goal, we have always shipped both import and export features as a part of the app. You can use these tools to migrate to jpstudy from a previous study tool, or to access your data for easy use elsewhere. Whether you are coming or going, we've got you covered.
